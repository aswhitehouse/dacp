DACP 3-Stage Security Workflow Demo

This demonstrates a comprehensive security operations workflow with DACP orchestration:
- Stage 1: Threat Analyzer Agent - Analyzes security events for potential threats
- Stage 2: Risk Assessor Agent - Evaluates threats and provides risk scores + recommendations  
- Stage 3: Incident Responder Agent - Coordinates incident response when risk threshold exceeded

Features demonstrated:
- Multi-agent orchestration with sequential data flow
- Conditional escalation (Stage 3 triggers when risk >= 7.0)
- Multi-engine integration (Claude + OpenAI working together)
- Real-world security operations automation
